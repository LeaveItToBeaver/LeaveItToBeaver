# HI! My name is Jason Beaver and this is my GitHub.

### A little about me

I was born and raised in a small town in North Carolina. Since childhood, I have always had a passion for computers. My family has always told me that at the age of three, I started waking up early in the morning only to hop on the computer and pirate games and movies online. Whether or not that is true, I can tell you for sure that I have a deep-rooted passion for understanding computers and programming.
When I was a child, I used to take apart any electronic I could get my hands on. My poor mother had to keep vigilant at all times; stepping on a Lego is bad, imagine stepping on a servo torn out of an R.C. car.

As I got older my interest in computers never waned. I moved from taking apart electronics to taking apart websites. That then grew into building text adventure games in Java. Spending hours on the family computer designing multiple endings to a simple story.

Fast forward 15 years later and here I am; still programming, but now I get paid to do it.

# What kind of projects will you find here?
My projects run the gamut of mobile applications written in the Flutter framework or React Native to full-stack applications that range from MEAN to RF.

I have a table below to demonstrate where I am with my projects and what they do.

| Project | Description | Status |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| HERD-Old | A Flutter application that is built to be a replacement for traditional social media. It is built on top of the Flutter Framework using the BLoC architecture with a Firebase backend. This is an old passion project and I am working on an updated version now. | Archived |
| My Wedding Website | This is a React.JS application built on top of Firebase. I didn't have too much time to develop this one so I really had to hit the ground running with a tried and tested database. | Complete |
| My Blogging Website | This website is built using SvelteKit and Supabase managed by PostgreSQL. To manage the CSS, I am using Tailwind as well as Daisy UI. I will use this website as a blog and Dev Journal. | In-Progress/Public |
| HERD | A Flutter application that is built to be a replacement for traditional social media. It is built on top of the Flutter Framework using the BLoC architecture with a Firebase backend. Facebook, Twitter, and, Instagram are all platforms of the past. My goal here is to build a social media platform of the future using tried and true methods while also expanding upon new ideas. | In-Progress/Hidden |
